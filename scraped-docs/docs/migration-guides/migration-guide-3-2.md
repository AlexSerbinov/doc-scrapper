# [Migrate AI SDK 3.1 to 3.2](#migrate-ai-sdk-31-to-32)


Check out the [AI SDK 3.2 release blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-ai-sdk-3-2) for more information about the release.

This guide will help you upgrade to AI SDK 3.2:

-   Experimental `StreamingReactResponse` functionality has been removed
-   Several features have been deprecated
-   UI framework integrations have moved to their own Node modules


## [Upgrading](#upgrading)



### [AI SDK](#ai-sdk)


To update to AI SDK version 3.2, run the following command using your preferred package manager:

pnpm add ai@latest


## [Removed Functionality](#removed-functionality)


The experimental `StreamingReactResponse` has been removed. You can use [AI SDK RSC](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/overview) to build streaming UIs.


## [Deprecated Functionality](#deprecated-functionality)


The `nanoid` export has been deprecated. Please use [`generateId`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-id) instead.


## [UI Package Separation](#ui-package-separation)


AI SDK UI supports several frameworks: [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

The integrations (other than React and RSC) have moved to separate Node modules. You need to update the import and require statements as follows:

-   Change `ai/svelte` to `@ai-sdk/svelte`
-   Change `ai/vue` to `@ai-sdk/vue`
-   Change `ai/solid` to `@ai-sdk/solid`

The old exports are still available but will be removed in a future release.
