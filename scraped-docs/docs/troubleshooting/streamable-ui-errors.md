# [Streamable UI Component Error](#streamable-ui-component-error)



## [Issue](#issue)


-   Variable Not Found
-   Cannot find `div`
-   `Component` refers to a value, but is being used as a type


## [Solution](#solution)


If you encounter these errors when working with streamable UIs within server actions, it is likely because the file ends in `.ts` instead of `.tsx`.
