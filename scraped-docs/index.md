Sully

@SullyOmarr

the @aisdk is probably the best way to build an ai app right now

you can go from idea -> working ai app in 15 mins.

its made working with llms 10x more enjoyable ( and we ship faster)

Hands down the @aisdk is by far the best SDK I have worked with, thats pretty much all things since jQuery.

Vercel AI SDK is so good, there's no reason to directly use npm/openai or npm/claude anymore

Vercel's AI SDK is one of the first tools I reach for when I'm building an AI-powered feature in TypeScript.

@0xblacklight

Vercel's @aisdk is insanely good. Docs are fantastic. Great abstractions where you want them, doesn't force unnecessary ones, and lets you get under the hood where appropriate. Solves the hard stuff (stream parsing, tool streaming, multi-turn tool execution, error handling and healing/recovery) without forcing you into dumb patterns

It just works, it's fantastic software and delightful to use. The team ships insanely fast, and has turned PRs from me around in like 2 days, and frequently ships requested features in < 1w

With the ai sdk available i'm always thinking: "How can I make this process as automatic as possible for the user?" because the barrier to implementing it is just a matter of minutes.

@benhylak

@aisdk has made it possible to just call "generateObject" across any model provider, and it returns a properly typed json object.

it's pure magic.
